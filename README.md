# todolist-v2
The second updated version of my personal to do list project.
It allows us to add items in our collection and to delete them as we keep accomplishing our tasks.
Further, this app allows us to maintain separate lists for all of our different requirements, be it school, office, movie-lists, etc. This has been made possible by EJS templates and layouts.
It involves the use of Mongoose to interact with our MongoDB database. The database was a necessity to ensure our lists do not get wiped out everytime we restart our server.
The aforementioned database is also remotely hosted online using MongoDB Atlas.
The backend has been made using Node.js and its framework Express.
The frontend has been made using JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
